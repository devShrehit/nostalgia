# 🏏 Hand Cricket Game – Console Edition (Java)
Remember those good old days when we used to play hand cricket during school breaks? Yeah, that fun little game with just our hands and some imagination. Well, this is a console-based Java prototype of that same classic game!

This version is a Player vs Computer match with all the nostalgic elements — an Odd-Even toss, simple run logic, wickets, and a live scorecard — all wrapped in an interactive terminal experience. No fancy graphics here (yet 😉), just pure logic and fun.

# 🎯 Note: This is a non-UI program for now. But I do plan to create a version with a graphical interface and even include Player vs Player mode in the future — that's a story for another day!

# 🙏 A Small Note
This is my first long project, and there may be a few rough edges. If you come across any bugs or limitations, please try to overlook them. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed building it, and maybe—just maybe—it’ll take you back to those childhood days.
